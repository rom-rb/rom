title: Framework setup

Quick style setup is suitable for simple, quick'n'dirty scripts that need to access databases, in a typical application setup, you want to break down individual component definitions, like relations or commands, into separate files and define them as explicit classes.

^INFO
#### ROM & Frameworks

Framework integrations **take care of the setup for you**. If you want to use ROM with a framework, please refer to specific instructions for that framework
^

## Setup

To do setup in flat style, create a `ROM::Configuration` object. This is the same object that gets yielded into your block in block-style setup, so the API is identical.

```ruby
configuration = ROM::Configuration.new(:memory, 'memory://test')
configuration.relation(:users)
# ... etc
```

When youâ€™re finished configuring, pass the configuration object to `ROM.container` to generate the finalized container. There are no differences in the internal semantics between block-style and flat-style setup.

### Registering Components

ROM components need to be registered with the ROM configuration in order to be used.

```ruby
configuration = ROM::Configuration.new(:memory, 'memory://test')

# Declare Relations, Commands, and Mappers here
```

If you prefer to create explicit classes for your components you must register them with the configuration directly:

```ruby
configuration = ROM::Configuration.new(:memory, 'memory://test')

configuration.register_relation(OneOfMyRelations)
configuration.register_relation(AnotherOfMyRelations)
configuration.register_command(User::CreateCommand)
configuration.register_mapper(User::UserMapper)
```

You can pass multiple components to each `register` call, as a list of arguments.

### Auto-registration

ROM provides `auto_registration` as a convenience method for automatically `require`-ing and registering components that are not declared with the DSL. At a minimum, `auto_registration` requires a base directory. By default, it will load relations from `<base>/relations`, commands from `<base>/commands`, and mappers from `<base>/mappers`.

#### Namespaces inferred from directory structure

By default, auto-registration assumes that the directory structure reflects your module/class organization, for example:

```ruby
# lib/persistence/relations/users.rb
module Persistence
  module Relations
    class Users < ROM::Relation[:memory]
      schema(:users, infer: true) # Notice the dataset name is set explicitly
    end
  end
end

configuration = ROM::Configuration.new(:memory)
configuration.auto_register('root_dir/lib/persistence/')
container = ROM.container(configuration)
```

^INFO
In this scenario the [Dataset](/learn/introduction/glossary#dataset) name will need to be set explicitly otherwise the fully qualified relation name will be used, in this case `:persistence_relations_users`.
^

#### Explicit namespace name

If your directory structure doesn't reflect module/class organization but you do namespace components, then you can set up auto-registration via `:namespace` option:

``` ruby
# lib/relations/users.rb
module Persistence
  module Relations
    class Users < ROM::Relation[:sql]
      schema(:users, infer: true)
    end
  end
end
```

Notice that the directory structure is different from our module structure. Since we use `Persistence` as our namespace, we need to set it explicitly so ROM can locate our relation after loading:

```ruby
configuration = ROM::Configuration.new(:memory)
configuration.auto_register('/path/to/lib', namespace: 'Persistence')
container = ROM.container(configuration)
```

Keep in mind with this namespace strategy, each component must be located under a module matching the components name:

```ruby
# Commands
#
# lib/commands/update_user_command.rb
module Persistence
  module Commands
    class UpdateUserCommand < ROM::SQL:Commands::Create
      relation :users
      register_as :update_user_command

      def execute(tuple); end
    end
  end
end

# Mappers
#
# lib/mappers/user_mapper.rb
module Persistence
  module Mappers
    class UserMapper < ROM::Transformer
      relation :users
      register_as :user_mapper

      map_array do; end
    end
  end
end
```

If your components are under a nested namespace like `MyApp::Persistence`, you can send your nested namespace as the `namespace` argument to `#auto_registration`, like so:

``` ruby
# lib/relations/users.rb
module MyApp
  module Persistence
    module Relations
      class Users < ROM::Relation[:sql]
        schema(:users, infer: true)
      end
    end
  end
end
```

Then, auto-registration can be achieved with

```ruby
configuration.auto_register('/path/to/lib', namespace: 'MyApp::Persistence')
```

#### Turning namespace off

If you keep all components under `{path}/(relations|commands|mappers)` directories and don't namespace them, then you can simply turn namespacing off:

``` ruby
# lib/relations/users.rb
class Users < ROM::Relation[:sql]
  schema(infer: true)
end
```

```ruby
configuration = ROM::Configuration.new(:memory)
configuration.auto_register('/path/to/lib', namespace: false)
container = ROM.container(configuration)
```

## Relations

Relations can be defined with a class extending `ROM::Relation` from the appropriate adapter.

```ruby
# Defines a Users relation for the SQL adapter
class Users < ROM::Relation[:sql]

end

# Defines a Posts relation for the HTTP adapter
class Posts < ROM::Relation[:http]

end
```

Relations can declare the specific [gateway](/learn/introduction/glossary#gateway) and [dataset](/learn/introduction/glossary#dataset) it takes data from, as well as the registered name of the relation. The following example sets the default options explicitly:

```ruby
class Users < ROM::Relation[:sql]
  gateway :default # the gateway name, as defined in setup

  # the first argument to schema() is the dataset name;
  # by default it is inferred from the class name
  #
  # `as:` provides the registered name;
  # under this name the relation will be available in repositories
  schema(:users, as: :users) do
    # ...
  end
end
```

## Commands

Just like Relations, Commands can be defined as explicit classes:

```ruby
class CreateUser < ROM::Commands::Create[:memory]

end
```

Commands have three settings: their relation, which takes the registered name of a relation; their result type, either `:one` or `:many`; and their registered name.

```ruby
class CreateUser < ROM::Commands::Create[:memory]
   register_as :create
   relation :users
   result :one
end
```

^INFO
Typically, you're going to use [repository command interface and changesets](/learn/repository/%{version}/quick-start); custom command classes are useful when the built-in command support in repositories doesn't meet your requirements.
